    Optimize the additive growth of a network G based on a metric that

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : networkx.classes.graph.Graph
        Final network.
    folder_name : str
        Name of the folder. If override_naming is True, then full name
        of the folder, otherwise standardized suffixe are added based on
        the options of the functions.
    metric_optimized : str
        Name of the metric optimized. Can be directness and 
        relative_coverage.
    local_proj : str
        Projected crs of the graph. If None, tries to find it based on the
        latitude and longitude position of a node in the graph.
    buff_size : float, optional
        Size of the buffer used to measure the coverage.
        The default is 500.
    override_naming : bool, optional
        If True, then the folder_name is the full name and nothing is
        added. The default is False.
    built : bool, optional
        If True, make a difference between the built part of the network
        and the planned part. The default is True.
    keep_connected : bool, optional
        If True, the number of components of the graph can never exceed 1
        if there is not a built network, or the number of components
        of the built network. The default is True.
    profiling : bool, optional
        If True, make a profile of the time spent by the function on 
        various functions. The default is True.
    save_network : bool, optional
        If True, save G as final_network.gpickle in the result's folder.
        The default is True.
    save_metrics : bool, optional
        If True, save the metrics coverage and directness as arrays

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        Raised if the value of the input metric_optimized is not a

    -------

    """
    Find the edge to add to the actual_edges list from the final graph G
    that optimizes the relative coverage, and that doesn't create an
    additional component if keep_connected is True. The relative coverage
    is defined here as the difference in the area before and after adding
    the edge, divided by the length of the added edge. The buffer size
    is determined by the BUFF_SIZE constant.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : networkx.classes.graph.Graph
        Graph on which we want to remove an edge.
    buff_size : float
        Constant that determines the buffer that we apply on the edge's
        geometry. For good results, the BUFFER_SIZE need to be the same
        that the one used for other values from the geom dict.
    project : pyproj.transformer.Transformer
        Tranformer modifying the geographic crs to the
        local projected crs of the graph.
    actual_edges : list
        List of the edges that are already created from G.
    edgelist : list

    bef_area : float
        Area of the buffered edges of G.
    geom : dict
        Dictionary with edges of G as keys and the corresponding
        buffered geometry as values.
    keep_connected : bool, optional
        If True, edges that can be added are not creating a new 
        component. The default is False.

    new_m : float
        Value of the relative coverage if the edge chosen is added
